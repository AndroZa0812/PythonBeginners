  - Architecture:
    - `main.py`: Main entry point of the application.
    - `data_loader.py`: Loads the dataset and preprocesses it.
    - `recommender.py`: Contains the logic for recommendation system.
    - `models.py`: Contains machine learning models for recommendation.
    - `data/ratings.csv`: Sample dataset containing user ratings for movies.
