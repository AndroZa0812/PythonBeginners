# Exercises for Lesson 4: Functions and Classes

1. **Functions**
   - Write a Python function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

2. **Classes**
   - Create a Python class named `Car` with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Implement a method to display the car's information.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Define a base class `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Create two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, each overriding the `speak()` method to return a different sound.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Implement a function that takes an object of any class derived from `Animal` and calls its `speak()` method.
